You are given an array A of size n containing positive integers, along with another array X of size m that specifies 
the indices of elements to be dropped from array A.

Your task is to remove the elements at the specified indices from array A and then print the modified array as output.

Constraints:
------------
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4

1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4

1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^6

All the elements of the second array  of size M should be distinct.

The index of the elements in the array start from 0

Any elements of array X cannot be negitive.


Input Format:
--------------
The first line of the input accepts an integer displaying the size of the array(n)
The second line of the input accepts the elements of the array of size n. each separated by a space
The third line of the input accepts an integer displaying the size of the array(m).
The fourth line of input accepts the elements of the array of size m. each separated by a space. These elements contains consists of the indices we want to drop from the main array which is of size n.

Output Format:
--------------
A single line of output displays the array after dropping the elements.

Sample Input 1:
---------------
4
1 2 3 4
2
2 3

Sample Output 1:
----------------
1 2

Explanation
------------
The First line of input creates an array of size 4. The elements of this array is mentioned in the second line of input
i.e.[1,2,3,4]. The third line of input is an array of size 2 which means that 2 elements from the array A need to be 
dropped . The fourth line of input contains the array( [2,3]) which displays that the elements of indices 2 and 3 need
to be dropped from the main array([1,2,3,4]).
The final output is array:[1,2]

Sample Input 2:
---------------
6
3 4 5 6 3 2
1
2

Sample Output 2:
----------------
3 4 6 3 2

Explanation 
-----------
The First line of input creates an array of size 6. The elements of this array is mentioned in the second line of input
i.e.[3,4,5,6,3,2]. The third line of input is an array of size 1 which means that 1 elements from the array  needs to 
be
dropped . The fourth line of input contains the array( [2]) which displays that the elements of indices 2 need to be 
dropped from the main array([3,4,5,6,3,2]).
The final output is array:[3,4,6,3,2]

A University named "XYZ" sends the question papers for the different  subjects to different colleges in a zipped file 
along with a secret key to access them.

The Dean appoints squad to different colleges and gives them the following cipher algorithm to be used to find out the 
password required to open the zip file:

i)Take the question paper’s name P and the secret key K (which can be positive or negative).
ii)Displace all the lowercase English alphabets present in P by K.All the uppercase alphabets, numbers, spaces, and
special characters are retained as it is.
iii)If K is positive, displace to the right and if K is negative, displace to the left.
iV)The lower limit and upper limit of the character's ASCII value generated after K displacement is 65 and 126.
V)During right displacement, if the value exceeds 126,then start again from 65. while during left displacement, if the 
value goes back from 126.

The squads perform these steps to find out the password required to open the file and take out the printouts to conduct
the examination.

write a program by reading the input from STDIN and the output from STDOUT you should not write arbitary strings while
reading the input and while printing as these contribute to the standard output.

Constraints:
-------------
i)P should not contain more than 50 characters.
iI)-50 ≤ K ≤ 50

Input Format:
-------------
The first line contains the question paper's name P.
The second line contains the secret key K.

Output Format:
--------------
The output contains a single string which is the password required to open the zip file.

Sample Input 1:
---------------
Operating Systems
-40

Sample Output 1:
----------------
OH(JwLAF) SQKL(EK

Explanation-1:
--------------
Given question paper name P is "Operating Systems" and k Value is -40


consider the the table given below:
